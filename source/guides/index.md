# Getting Started

Ready to get started with some guides? Check out the table of contents
to the right.

## Philosophy

This is a community project. The sole aim is to make front-end
development better for everyone. If you see any issues with the guides
please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/hybridgroup/betterfrontend/issues) or simply make a pull request for the [#betterfrontend github project.](https://github.com/hybridgroup/betterfrontend)

## What is Front-End Development?

Front-End Development is programming the visual layer of
web-applications. Web applications like [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com), [Github](http://www.github.com), and [Kanbanpad](http://www.kanbanpad.com) look
the way they do *because* of Front-End Development.

According to job descriptions and community opinion, here are the
following skill-sets required for becoming a Front-End Developer:

### Requirements

* Expert knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS
* Comfortable developing production ready interface designs
* Experience in rapid prototyping (using just HTML/CSS to prototype UI)

### Should be passionate about

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Scss
* Compass
* Web Standards
* Beautiful interfaces & typography

### You're exceptional if you

* Are proficient with Photoshop and Illustrator
* Have developed any open source plugins related to front-end
* Can dissect the entire DOM and presentational markup with your minds
  built-in web-inspector
* Dream in CSS3 multi-stop gradients and general nuttiness.

### Optional Plusses

* Knowledge of Git and Ruby. (Many bleeding edge companies use these
  technologies).
* Having a Github account
* Examples of HTML/CSS Experiements

Keep the above in mind when applying to jobs, creating jobs, and or
creating a path to learn.
