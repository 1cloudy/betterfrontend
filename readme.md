# #betterfrontend is a movement to improve Front-End Development

This repository will serve as a style guide for tools and libraries that are
used in front-end development.

A major problem with front-end development is that it doesn't have a
clear definition of what it is in itself, and the skills that are used
don't have much documentation. As a result, the learning curve is *too
damn high* and it's diffilcult to find best practices on how to do
things better. 

The goal of this repository is to help alievate the definition problems
and provide style guides as well as general best practices.

The following things will be defined:

* Front-End Development
* Tools used with Front-End Development
* How to work on the Stylesheet layer effectively (CSS, Scss).
* How to work on the HTML layer effectively (Html, Haml, erb, mustache).
* How to work on the front-end layer of a web-application framework
  effectively.

# A Stylesheet Guide Meant for Web-Applications

This is a stylesheet guide that was created under the idea of working
with web-applications, and specifically Ruby on Rails.

CSS and SCSS are both taken in mind for this guide. Styles are the
overall concept, and the technoligies behind it are a few different
libaries (CSS, Scss, Compass).
