# #betterfrontend is a movement to improve Front-End Development

Website coming soon for more information. (will be at
http://www.betterfrontend.com)

Official twitter: twitter.com/betterfrontend

This repository will serve as a style guide for tools and libraries that are
used in front-end development.

A major problem with front-end development is that it doesn't have a
clear definition of what it is in itself, and the skills that are used
don't have much documentation. As a result, the learning curve is *too
damn high* and it's diffilcult to find best practices on how to do
things better. 

The goal of this repository is to help alievate the definition problems
and provide style guides as well as general best practices.

The following things will be defined:

* Front-End Development
* Tools used with Front-End Development
* How to work on the Stylesheet layer effectively (CSS, Scss).
* How to work on the HTML layer effectively (Html, Haml, erb, mustache).
* How to work on the front-end layer of a web-application framework
  effectively (Rails focused for now).

**If you disagree with anything in this document. PLEASE file an issue
so we can improve the community as a whole. This is a movement of
collaboration and refinement.**

**Our mission is to make front-end development better for you, your
team, and everyone else**

## What is Front-End Development?

Front-End Development is programming the visual layer of a
web-application. Ruby apps like Hulu, Github, and Kanbanpad look the way
they do *because* of front-end development. A front-end developer is
just as nessecary as a back-end developer, despite this nessecity;
front-end development has a severe lack of attention and care. This
leads to huge problems for our community and we need to fix it.

Front-end development requires *masterful* use of HTML & CSS. This is
due to the complexity of frameworks like Ruby on Rails. This repository
shall serve as a guideline of how to reach that level of mastery.
